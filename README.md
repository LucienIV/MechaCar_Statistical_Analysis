## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
The results for the linear regression were as follows:

As can be seens, the angle of the spoiler and the presence of All Wheel Drive provide a non-random amount of variance to the Miles Per Gallon values in the dataset. The weight of the vehicle also provides a non-random amount of variance, albeit less than the prior two variables. The p value returned for the intercept indicated that the null hypothesis can be rejected as the slope is not considered to be zero. The R-Squared value indicates that the linear model will predict the mpg of the prototypes with relative effectiness. As it stands with the current data the model can predict with rouoghly seventy percent accuracy.
